'''
Create a program for the auto shop that can be used for direct drive vehicles 
that will calculate the accuracy increase or decrease of the speedometer and 
odometer when the customer wants to change their tire diameter. For example, if 
standard tires are 14” and a customer wants to change it to 18”, what will be 
the impact to their speedometer and odometer? Bonus: Include the wear in your 
program for the customer whose tires are worn.
